The Skymod is a series of mods for the VzBot 330. It includes all mods i have created and implemented on my Vz330. The purpose of this mod collection is to make the printer more reliable, stable, easier to use or to be more fitting to my liking. Also it allows me to have all mods in one condenced place.
