# Skymod



The Skymod is a series of mods for the VzBot 330. It includes all mods i have created and implemented on my Vz330. The purpose of this mod collection is to make the printer more reliable, stable, easier to use or to be more fitting to my liking. Also it allows me to have all mods in one condenced place.

Short overview of the mods:

* Frame extension
* modded gantry parts for higher quality idlers (10mm height)
* Frontpanel design
* Internal spool holder for filament
* quad z 
* reworked top hat hinge



Not all mods are finished and implemented yet. At the moment im working on the quad z.
